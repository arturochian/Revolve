	abstract = {Ecological theory predicts that competition for a limiting resourcewill lead to the exclusion of species unless the within-species effects outweigh the betweenspecies effects. Understanding how multiple competitors might coexist on a single resource has focused on the prescriptive formalism of a necessary niche width and limiting similarity. Here, we show how continuously varying life histories and trade-offs in these characteristics can allow multiple competitors to coexist, and we reveal how limiting similarity emerges and is shaped by the ecological and evolutionary characteristics of competitors. In this way, we illustrate how the interplay of ecological and evolutionary processes acts to shape ecological communities in a unique way. This leads us to argue that evolutionary processes (life-history trait trade-offs) are fundamental to the understanding of the structure of ecological communities.},

We also study how trophic interactions, interference competition, and energy availability affect a food web’s maximum trophic level and contrast this with conditions for high diversity. We find that there is not always a positive relationship between conditions that promote initial diversification and eventual diversity, and that the most diverse food webs often do not have the highest trophic levels.},

However, it uses an oversimplified picture of seed tolerance, with an infinitely sharp threshold: the probability that a seed tolerate a given stress level is either 1 or 0. This invites a revision of the model, presented here. We demonstrate that this simplification has large impacts on model behavior, including altering predictions regarding limiting similarity, raising expected diversity levels, and lessening expected spacing between species along the trait axis. Such dramatic impacts ultimately stem from the fact that a discontinuity in the probability of tolerating a site drastically reduces competition between similar species. This is one example of a class of models with a nondifferentiable peak in the competition kernel, which we recently showed is produced by resource use unrealistically modeled as discontinuous and affects fundamental predictions regarding limiting similarity. This article illustrates those general results and offers a revised model of the tolerance-fecundity trade-off.},

	abstract = {Understanding speciation is a fundamental biological problem. It is believed that many species originated through allopatric divergence, where new species arise from geographically isolated populations of the same ancestral species1–3. In contrast, the possibility of sympatric speciation (in which new species arise without geographical isolation) has often been dismissed, partly because of theoretical {difficulties2,3.Most} previous models analysing sympatric speciation concentrated on particular aspects of the problem while neglecting others4–10. Here we present a model that integrates a novel combination of different features and show that sympatric speciation is a likely outcome of competition for resources. We use multilocus genetics to describe sexual reproduction in an individual-based model, and we consider the evolution of assortative mating (where individuals mate preferentially with like individuals) depending either on an ecological character affecting resource use or on a selectively neutral marker trait. In both cases, evolution of assortative mating often leads to reproductive isolation between ecologically diverging subpopulations. When assortative mating depends on a marker trait, and is therefore not directly linked to resource competition, speciation occurs when genetic drift breaks the linkage equilibrium between the marker and the ecological trait. Our theory conforms well with mounting empirical evidence for the sympatric origin of many species10–18},

Such adaptive traits naturally arise in a great variety of settings: variable or heterogeneous environments, age-structured populations, phenotypic plasticity, patterns of growth and form, resource gradients, and in many other areas of evolutionary ecology. Adaptive dynamics theory allows analysing the long-term evolution of such traits under the density-dependent and frequency-dependent selection pressures resulting from feedback between evolving populations and their ecological environment. Starting from individual-based considerations, we derive equations describing the expected dynamics of a function-valued trait in asexually reproducing populations under mutation-limited evolution, thus generalizing the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics to function-valued traits. We explain in detail how to account for various kinds of evolutionary constraints on the adaptive dynamics of function-valued traits. To illustrate the utility of our approach, we present applications to two specific examples that address, respectively, the evolution of metabolic investment strategies along resource gradients, and the evolution of seasonal flowering schedules in temporally varying environments.},

We show that the coevolutionary dynamic can be envisaged as a directed random walk in the community's trait space. A quantitative description of this stochastic process in terms of a master equation is derived. By determining the first jump moment of this process we abstract the dynamic of the mean evolutionary path. To first order the resulting equation coincides with a dynamic that has frequently been assumed in evolutionary game theory. Apart from recovering this canonical equation we systematically establish the underlying assumptions. We provide higher order corrections and show that these can give rise to new, unexpected evolutionary effects including shifting evolutionary isoclines and evolutionary slowing down of mean paths as they approach evolutionary equilibria. Extensions of the derivation to more general ecological settings are discussed. In particular we allow for multi-trait coevolution and analyze coevolution under nonequilibrium population dynamics.},

Here, we develop a general quantitative model predicting how offspring size should scale with adult size by combining a simple model for life-history evolution with a frequency-dependent survivorship model. The key innovation is that larger offspring are afforded three different advantages during ontogeny: higher survivorship per time, a shortened juvenile phase, and advantage during size-competitive growth. In this model, it turns out that size-asymmetric advantage during competition is the factor driving evolution towards larger offspring sizes. For simplified and limiting cases the model is shown to produce the same predictions as the previously existing theory it is founded on. The explicit treatment of different survival advantages has biologically important new effects, mainly through an interaction between total maternal investment in reproduction and the duration of competitive growth. This leads on to explain alternative allometries between log offspring size and log adult size, as observed in mammals (slope=0.95) and plants (slope=0.54). Further, it suggests how these differences relate quantitatively to specific biological processes during recruitment. In these ways the model generalizes across previous theory and provides explanations for some differences between major taxa.},

A single seed size is found to be never evolutionarily stable. I always find at least some continuous adaptive variation in seed size. The model generates the following predictions. At least some continuous variation in seed size is adaptive. Plants with many resources have more variable seeds than plants with few resources. Plants with low juvenile mortality have more variable seeds than plants with high juvenile mortality. Plants with aggregated seed dispersal have seed size distributions that are more biased toward small seeds compared to plants with more even seed dispersal. An explicit formula for the evolutionarily stable seed size distribution was obtained for Poisson-distributed seed numbers and for negative binomial distributed seed numbers per safe site. The application of the model to seed size distributions of entire populations or plant communities is discussed. [References: 60]},

Of particular interest is a type of singular strategy that is an evolutionary attractor from a great distance, but once in its neighbourhood a population becomes dimorphic and undergoes disruptive selection leading to evolutionary branching.

If the evolution of seed size is mutation-limited and single mutations have only a small phenotypic effect, then an initially monomorphic population reaches the final evolutionarily stable polymorphic state through one or more discrete evolutionary branching events. At each such branching event, a given lineage already present in the population divides into two phenotypically diverging daughter lines, each with its own seed size. If the precompetitive survival of seeds and seedlings is high for small and large seeds alike, however, evolutionary branching may be followed by the extinction of one or more lineages.

There is now a deeper understanding of how competitive interactions influence community structure, for instance, how the shape of competition kernels can determine the clustering of species' traits. Competition is typically weaker for greater phenotypic difference, and the shape of the dependence defines a competition kernel. The clustering tendencies of kernels interact with other effects, such as variation in resource availability along a niche axis, but the kernel shape can have a decisive influence on community structure.

	abstract = {We define a fitness concept applicable to structured metapopulations consisting of infinitely many equally coupled patches. In addition, we introduce a more easily calculated quantity R-m that relates to fitness in the same manner as R-o relates to fitness in ordinary population dynamics: the R-m of a mutant is only defined when the resident population dynamics concierges to a point equilibrium and R-m is larger (smaller) than 1 if and only if mutant fitness is positive (negative). R-m corresponds to the average number of newborn dispersers resulting from the ton average less than one) local colony founded by a newborn disperser. Efficient algorithms for calculating its numerical value are provided. As an example of the usefulness of these concepts we calculate the evolutionarily stable conditional dispersal strategy for individuals that can account for the local population density in their dispersal decisions. Below a threshold density (x) over tilde, at which staying and leaving are equality profitable, everybody should stay and above (x) over tilde everybody should leave, where profitability is measured as the mean number of dispersers produced through lines of descent consisting of only non-dispersers.

	abstract = {Beginners in life history theory or evolutionary ecology seemingly face a variety of almost unrelated approaches. Yet the biomathematical literature of the last 10–20 years reflects the implicit acceptance of a common evolutionary framework, the core idea being that there exists a unique general fitness measure that concisely summarizes the overall time course of potential invasions by initially rare mutant phenotypes. Using such an invasion criterion to characterize fitness implicitly presupposes a scenario in which, during periods o f clear evolutionary change, the rate of evolution is set primarily by the random occurrence (and initial establishment) of favourable mutations. Evolutionarily stable life history strategies ({ESSs)} may then be regarded as traps for the evolutionary random walk.},

	abstract = {Seed size commonly varies by five to six orders of magnitude among coexisting plant species, a pattern ecologists have long sought to explain. Because seed size trades off with seed number, small-seeded species clearly have the advantage in fecundity, but what is the countervailing advantage of large seeds? Higher competitive ability combined with strong competitive asymmetry can in theory allow coexistence through a competition–colonization trade-off, but empirical evidence is inconsistent with this mechanism. Instead, the key advantage of large seeds appears to be their tolerance of stresses such as shade or drought that are present in some but not all regeneration sites. Here I present a simple, analytically tractable model of species coexistence in heterogeneous habitats through a tolerance–fecundity trade-off. Under this mechanism, the more tolerant species win all of the more stressful regeneration sites and some of those that are less stressful, whereas the more fecund species win most but not all of the less stressful sites. The tolerance–fecundity trade-off enables stable coexistence of large numbers of species in models with and without seed limitation. The tolerance–fecundity mechanism provides an excellent explanation for the maintenance of diversity of seed size within plant communities and also suggests new hypotheses for coexistence in animal and microbial communities.},

	abstract = {Dispersal polymorphism and evolutionary branching of dispersal strategies has been found in several metapopulation models. The mechanism behind those findings has been temporal variation caused by cyclic or chaotic local dynamics, or temporally and spatially varying carrying capacities. We present a new mechanism: spatial heterogeneity in the sense of different patch types with sufficient proportions, and temporal variation caused by catastrophes. The model where this occurs is a generalization of the model by Gyllenberg and Metz (2001). Their model is a size-structured metapopulation model with infinitely many identical patches. We present a generalized version of their metapopulation model allowing for different types of patches. In structured population models, defining and computing fitness in polymorphic situations is, in general, difficult. We present an efficient method, which can be applied also to other structured population or metapopulation models.},

	abstract = {Ecologists have long been puzzled by the fact that there are so many similar species in nature. Here we show that self-organized clusters of look-a-likes may emerge spontaneously from coevolution of competitors. The explanation is that there are two alternative ways to survive together: being sufficiently different or being sufficiently similar. Using a model based on classical competition theory, we demonstrate a tendency for evolutionary emergence of regularly spaced lumps of similar species along a niche axis. Indeed, such lumpy patterns are commonly observed in size distributions of organisms ranging from algae, zooplankton, and beetles to birds and mammals, and could not be well explained by earlier theory. Our results suggest that these patterns may represent self-constructed niches emerging from competitive interactions. A corollary of our findings is that, whereas in species-poor communities sympatric speciation and invasion of open niches is possible, species-saturated communities may be characterized by convergent evolution and invasion by look-a-likes.},

	abstract = {Adaptive dynamics in two-dimensional phenotype space is investigated by computer simulation. The model assumes Lotka-Voltera-type competition and a stochastic mutation process. The carrying capacity has a single maximum in the origin of the strategy space and the competition coefficient decreases with strategy difference. Evolutionary branching, an asexual analog of adaptive speciation, is observed with suitable parameters. The branching at the singular point, which is a fixed point of the directional evolution, may occur into two or three, but not more, directions. Further branchings may occur after the initial separation. The probability of threebranching is studied as a function of several parameters. We conclude that the two-way branching is the predominant mode of adaptive speciation.},
