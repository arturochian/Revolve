Adaptive Dynamics toolkit for R

Here we are trying to achieve two things:

1. A tool kit for exploring evolutionary models using techniques from
   adaptive dynamics.
2. Implement a number of classic models

Documentation for the classic models is currently in the `doc/`
directory, but will move into `inst/doc/` or `inst/vignettes`
directory shortly.
